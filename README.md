Open-source Production-grade Next.js boilerplates

## Why

I want to use boilerplates, but haven't come across any that were production-grade. 

What's production-grade, anyway? 

- strongly typed
- has tests
- avoid vendor lock
- opt-in functionality

## Design goals

- functionality should be bundled as packages
- sane defaults, but everything should be overridable
