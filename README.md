# Nextastic

Open-source Production-grade Next.js boilerplates

## Why

I bought a Next.js boilerplate, and was thoroughly disappointed by the code quality. I like to build quick, but I also like good code. These things shouldn't be mutually exclusive, so I'm sharing Nextastic.

### What's production-grade, anyway? 

- strongly typed
- has tests (static & automated)
- avoid vendor lock
- opt-in functionality

## Design goals

- functionality should be bundled as packages
- sane defaults, but everything should be configurable
